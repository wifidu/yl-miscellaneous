caniuse-lite\n\n> A smaller version of caniuse-db, with only the essentials!\n\n## Why?\n\nThe full data behind [Can I use][1] is incredibly useful for any front end\ndeveloper, and on the website all of the details from the database are displayed\nto the user. However in automated tools, [many of these fields go unused][2];\nit's not a problem for server side consumption but client side, the less\nJavaScript that we send to the end user the better.\n\ncaniuse-lite then, is a smaller dataset that keeps essential parts of the data\nin a compact format. It does this in multiple ways, such as converting `null`\narray entries into empty strings, representing support data as an integer rather\nthan a string, and using base62 references instead of longer human-readable\nkeys.\n\nThis packed data is then reassembled (via functions exposed by this module) into\na larger format which is mostly compatible with caniuse-db, and so it can be\nused as an almost drop-in replacement for caniuse-db for contexts where size on\ndisk is important; for example, usage in web browsers. The API differences are\nvery small and are detailed in the section below.\n\n\n## API\n\n```js\nimport * as lite from 'caniuse-lite';\n```\n\n### `lite.agents`\n\ncaniuse-db provides a full `data.json` file which contains all of the features\ndata. Instead of this large file, caniuse-lite provides this data subset\ninstead, which has the `browser`, `prefix`, `prefix_exceptions`, `usage_global`\nand `versions` keys from the original.\n\nIn addition, the subset contains the `release_date` key with release dates (as timestamps) for each version:\n```json\n{\n  \"release_date\": {\n    \"6\": 998870400,\n    \"7\": 1161129600,\n    \"8\": 1237420800,\n    \"9\": 1300060800,\n    \"10\": 1346716800,\n    \"11\": 1381968000,\n    \"5.5\": 962323200\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### `lite.feature(js)`\n\nThe `feature` method takes a file from `data/features` and converts it into\nsomething that more closely represents the `caniuse-db` format. Note that only\nthe `title`, `stats` and `status` keys are kept from the original data.\n\n### `lite.features`\n\nThe `features` index is provided as a way to query all of the features that\nare listed in the `caniuse-db` dataset. Note that you will need to use the\n`feature` method on values from this index to get a human-readable format.\n\n### `lite.region(js)`\n\nThe `region` method takes a file from `data/regions` and converts it into\nsomething that more closely represents the `caniuse-db` format. Note that *only*\nthe usage data is exposed here (the `data` key in the original files).\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nThanks goes to these wonderful people ([emoji key](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors#emoji-key)):\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n| [<img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282980?v=3\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Ben Briggs</b></sub>](http://beneb.info)<br />[????](https://github.com/ben-eb/caniuse-lite/commits?author=ben-eb \"Code\") [????](https://github.com/ben-eb/caniuse-lite/commits?author=ben-eb \"Documentation\") [????](#review-ben-eb \"Reviewed Pull Requests\") [⚠️](https://github.com/ben-eb/caniuse-lite/commits?author=ben-eb \"Tests\") | [<img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1737375?v=3\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Andy Jansson</b></sub>](https://github.com/andyjansson)<br />[????](https://github.com/ben-eb/caniuse-lite/commits?author=andyjansson \"Code\") | [<img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/19343?v=4\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Andrey Sitnik</b></sub>](http://twitter.com/sitnikcode)<br />[????](https://github.com/ben-eb/caniuse-lite/commits?author=ai \"Code\") | <img src=\"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/947326?v=4\" width=\"100px;\"/><br /><sub><b>Igor Deryabin</b></sub><br />[????](https://github.com/ben-eb/caniuse-lite/commits?author=rodweb \"Code\") |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END -->\n\nThis project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) specification.
