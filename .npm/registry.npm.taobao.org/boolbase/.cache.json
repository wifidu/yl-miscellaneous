Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.\n\n###And why is this a separate module?\n\nI'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.","_attachments":{},"homepage":"https://github.com/fb55/boolbase","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/fb55/boolbase/issues"},"license":"ISC","_etag":"W/\"0bac99101c41d10a196397f88c937abc\""}
